"""Ordinary importable/executable entrypoint for the detached refresh watcher.

``PosixRefreshWatcherAdapter.spawn_detached`` used to launch the current
interpreter with the ~480-line generated watcher-program source passed
directly on argv (``sys.executable -c <script>``). This module replaces that
transport: the adapter now launches
``sys.executable -m lingtai.adapters.posix.refresh_watcher_entrypoint
<encoded-request>``, where ``<encoded-request>`` is the compact deterministic
JSON payload produced by ``lingtai.kernel.refresh_watcher.encode_request``.
This module is the only thing on argv; it decodes the request, renders the
same Core-owned watcher-program text
(``lingtai.kernel.refresh_watcher.watcher_program.render_watcher_script``),
and executes it in a fresh namespace — reproducing the exact same runtime
behavior (ACK/lock deadlines, relaunch retry, stale-duplicate cleanup,
bounded redaction, terminal-failure artifact/notification) the previous
``-c``-embedded source did.

This module is process/transport mechanism, not technology-neutral Core
logic, so it lives beside ``PosixRefreshWatcherAdapter`` under
``adapters/posix`` rather than in the kernel: it is only ever invoked as a
subprocess entrypoint via ``python -m``, and it is the adapter package that
already owns the concrete interpreter invocation, stream detachment, and
session mechanics for this Port (see ``refresh_watcher.py``). It performs no
policy of its own — ``main`` is a thin decode -> render -> exec pipeline —
so the watcher's actual behavior remains entirely owned by
``watcher_program.render_watcher_script``.
